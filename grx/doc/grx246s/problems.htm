<h1>Known GRX problems and things that must be improved</h1>

<h2>General:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The memory driver allocates all planes in one chunk instead
of using real planes.
<p>
<li>Printing in 1200dpi on Laserjet supporting PCL6 doesn't work.
</ul>

<h2>Win32 driver:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Drawline can be faster. Now when we paint a long diagonal line, the
invalidate rect is very big.
<p>
<li>Add a 16 bpp framedriver.
<p>
<li>The printing code doesn't work correctly.
</ul>

<h2>X11 driver:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Investigate why bccbgi test program doesn't restart when it switchs to
    text mode.
<p>
<li>Try to make GrPixel faster.
<p>
<li>The driver can't respond to PAINT events, so it has problems with
    XFree86 v4 because the backing-store is not enabled by default. The
    best solution is to have a context to save the actual window (and
    the GrPixel problem can be solved too). The workaround is to add 
    next lines to the /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 file, in the Device section:
<p>      Option "BackingStore"
<p>      Option "SaveUnders"
</ul>

<h2>Linux console framebuffer driver:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Try to change modes if the underlaying framebuffer driver allow it.
<p>
<li>Complete the alternate direct mouse driver (now it only handles
PS/2 and IMPS2 mice).
<p>
<li>Use the alternate input driver even when the Svgalib driver is included,
so virtual consoles can be switched.
</ul>

<h2>Linux console SVGALIB driver:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nedded alternate framedrivers for 1 and 4 bpp modes. The actual ones are
using inport/outport instructions and doesn't work with svgalib 1.9.x and
even with 1.4.x if the linux framebuffer is enabled.
<p>
<li>A bug in gcc 3.2 and never compilers abort the compilation with errors
like "can't find a register in class AD_REGS while reloading asm". No fix
at the moment. Workaround: change "-O2" to "-O1" in makedefs.grx.
</ul>

<h2>VGA DOS driver:</h2>
<ul>
<li>It can be improved a lot, replacing the generic funtions it uses.
<p>
<li>BitBlt to screen doens't work in 4bpp modes if the screen is not
set as the default context.
</ul>
